# Setup

## Backend

Install Python here: https://www.python.org/downloads/. When installing Python, make sure it is added to PATH variables <br>

This project uses the Flask framework. Here's how to use it: <br>
1. After Python has been installed, go to the backend directory in the command prompt<br>
2. Flask recommends using a virtual environment to ensure that libraries that use different python versions do not conflict <br>
3. To create the virtual environment, go to the command prompt and enter this: `py -3 -m venv venv` for Windows, and `python3 -m venv venv` for Mac/Linux <br>
4. Activate the virtual environment by entering this in the command prompt: `venv\Scripts\activate` for Windows, and `. venv/bin/activate` for Mac/Linux <br>
5. Install Flask in the virtual environment with `pip install Flask`
6. Navigate to the server directory in the backend directory, and enter this to start the server: `Flask -app server run`

## Frontend

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

2. Run `npm install` 
3. Start the app at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000), with `npm start`.
